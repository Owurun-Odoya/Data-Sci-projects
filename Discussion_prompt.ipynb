    " Microsoft visual studio supports multiple programming languages including C++, C#, and Visual Basic\n",
    " NetBeans is an an IDE for Java developers\n",
    " \n",
    "#### 2) Python built-in functions that work with lists\n",
    "len(): Returns the number of elements in a list 1.\n",
    "max(): Returns the maximum value in a list 1.\n",
    "min(): Returns the minimum value in a list 1.\n",
    "sorted(): Returns a sorted list of the specified iterable object\n",

    "#### 3) Interesting Numpy functions\n",
    "numpy.mean()\n",
    "numpy.array()\n",
    "numpy.std()\n",
    "numpy.sin()\n",
    "numpy.tan()\n",
    "numpy.cos()\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4) The difference between completing a task using a library and without using the library\n",
    "E.g To calculate the mean of a list you will need to define a function or do it manually, but using a numpy library you only need to call the mean() funtion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5) Cases where Libraries may not be useful\n",
    "Custom functionality: if the functionality to be executed is unique and does not exist in a library. If we want to execute a function say, center, which is not in any library and its definition, v = (v-mean(V)) / std(V). We simply subtract the mean of the distribution, and divide that value by the standard deviation of the distribution:for each value v in a distribution of values, V.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6) Generate a regular expression that you think would be useful for finding a piece of text. Can you come up with a really complicated one for a complicated case?\n",
    "E.g:  Removing special characters from a dataframe using regex, you can use the replace() method in pandas.\n",
    "df = df.replace({'A': {r'[^\\w\\s]': ''}}, regex=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "df: This is the name of the dataframe that we want to modify.\n",
    "\n",
    ".replace(): This is a method in pandas that allows us to replace values in a dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "{'A': {r'[^\\w\\s]': ''}}: This is a dictionary that specifies the replacement values. In this case, we are replacing values in column ‘A’ of the dataframe. The regular expression [^\\w\\s] matches any character that is not a word character (\\w) or whitespace (\\s). We are replacing these characters with an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "regex=True: This specifies that we want to use regular expressions to match the values we want to replace.\n",

    "#### 7) Week 15 What steps can be taken to ensure the longevity of data exporting services? Can you fdind any cases where legacy data has caused any issues, either in migration or through integrated middleware?\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the longevity of data exporting services, it is important to have a successful legacy data migration plan. Since data migration from legacy systems to a modern database means upgrading to the latest version of the existing database or transferring to a completely new database it is important to ensure that any system integration works correctly with old not-yet-migrated applications and the new ones that inspired the migration project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8) Week 17 Plots with three spatial dimensions are often difficult to interpret in 2-D mediums like monitors and on paper. What are the pros and cons to some alternatives including more than 2 dimensions in a plot?\n",
    "#### Can you think of any other novel forms of data representation?\n",
    "##### What are the drawbacks and benefits of such data representation strategies?\n",
    "\n",
    "PROS\n",
    "\n",
    "They can help users understand complex data more easily.\n",
    "They can help users see patterns and trends that might not be visible in 2D visualizations.\n",
    "They can help users see relationships between different data points more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "CONS\n",
    "Cognitively it may be hand to understand because many persons are used to 2-D plots.\n",
    "Judgemnt of depth can cause confusion\n",
    "Occlusion of certain parts of the plot by other plots may defeat the purpose of the visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "OTHER FORMS OF DATA VISUALIZATIONS \n",
    "A) Word Cloud is a type of data visualization that is used to represent trends like frequency of words in a text data.\n",
    "The benefit is: 1) One can in a single glance see the words that constitute a text-based data. (2) Certain inferences such as the most frequently occuring word in a text data can be madejust by looking at it\n",
    "Its drawbacks are: 1) Other text-based analysis such as sentiments cannot be derived from it\n",
    "2) Without removing stopwords it may return a visualization that includes words that are not relevant to the main point of the text data\n",
    "B) A Heat Map is a type of data visualization that is used to represent trends in large datasets using colors.\n",
    "Benefits include: 1) Colors are visually stimulating and help in drawing fine distinctions in trends. 2) They can be used to highlight areas of high or low activity.\n",
    "Drawbacks: 1) Colors have a point of diminishing return such that with more colors, especially the ones with similar hue, the distinction in trends become less clear.\n",
    "2) People with color perception deficiency will find it difficult to appreciate the heat maps  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9) Week 18 More advanced plotting packages (some in other languages other than python) allow for interactive plots to be generated. That is, plots that show data that can be changed by users . Can you find some of these online? What are your favorites?\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive plots allow for changes to be made to data by users.\n",
    "Some include Plotly, Bokeh, and Holoviews.\n",
    "My favorite is Plotly because it's free and available for offline use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10) Can you describe what a unit test is for and what some of its limitations are?\n",
    " A unit test is a type of software testing that checks individual units or components of a software application¹. The purpose of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed². Unit tests are typically automated tests that are written by developers⁶. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the advantages of using unit tests are:\n",
    "- It helps to identify bugs early in the development cycle.\n",
    "- It helps to improve the quality of the code.\n",
    "- It helps to reduce the cost of fixing bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some limitations to using unit tests:\n",
    "- Unit tests cannot detect integration or interfacing issues between two modules.\n",
    "- Unit tests cannot catch complex errors in the system ranging from multiple modules.\n",
    "- Unit tests cannot test non-functional attributes like usability, scalability, the overall performance of the system, etc.\n",
    "- Unit testing increases the amount of code that needs to be written.\n",
    "- It is problematic when testing your user interface (UI).\n",
    "- It may affect the product’s structural design and add indirection that is pointless¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 11) What are some other strategies for testing software?\n",
    "  There are many different types of software tests, each with specific objectives and strategies³. Some of the common testing strategies are:\n",
    "- Black box testing – Tests the functionality of the software without looking at the internal code structure.\n",
    "- White box testing – Tests the internal code structure and logic of the software.\n",
    "- Unit testing – Tests individual units or components of the software to ensure they are functioning as intended.\n",
    "- Integration testing – Tests the integration of different components of the software to ensure they work together as a system.\n",
    "- Functional testing – Tests the functional requirements of the software to ensure they are met.\n",
    "- System testing – Tests the complete software system to ensure it meets the specified requirements.\n",
    "- Acceptance testing – Tests the software to ensure it meets the customer’s or end-user’s expectations.\n",
    "- Regression testing – Tests the software after changes or modifications have been made to ensure the changes have not introduced new defects.\n",
    "- Performance testing – Tests the software to determine its performance characteristics such as speed, scalability, and stability.\n",
    "- Security testing – Tests the software to identify vulnerabilities and ensure it meets security requirements¹.\n",

    "#### 12) Select a feature of Git and describe:\n",
    "         i What it does\n",
    "         ii How it works (include a small example)\n",
    "         iii Why it is useful \n",
    "         iv Where it might fit in a specific workflow\n",
    " ##### ANSWER\n",
    "         Some features of Git include:\n",
    "         Git config\n",
    "         Git init\n",
    "         Git status\n",
    "         Git diff\n",
    "         Git add\n",
    "         Git commit\n",
    "Sure, I can help you with that. Here are the descriptions of each of the Git features you mentioned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Git config**\n",
    "   i. What it does: Git config is used to set configuration values for a user or a repository.\n",
    "   ii. How it works: The command takes a key-value pair as an argument and stores it in the Git configuration file. For example, to set the user name, you can use the following command: `git config --global user.name \"John Doe\"`.\n",
    "   iii. Why it is useful: It allows users to customize their Git environment and workflow.\n",
    "   iv. Where it might fit in a specific workflow: It is usually one of the first commands run after installing Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Git init**\n",
    "   i. What it does: Git init creates a new Git repository.\n",
    "   ii. How it works: The command creates a new directory with a .git subdirectory that contains all the necessary files for a Git repository. For example, to create a new repository in the current directory, you can use the following command: `git init`.\n",
    "   iii. Why it is useful: It allows users to start tracking changes in their codebase and collaborate with others.\n",
    "   iv. Where it might fit in a specific workflow: It is usually one of the first commands run when starting a new project.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Git status**\n",
    "   i. What it does: Git status shows the current state of the working directory and staging area.\n",
    "   ii. How it works: The command compares the current state of the working directory with the last commit and shows which files have been modified, added, or deleted. For example, to see the status of your repository, you can use the following command: `git status`.\n",
    "   iii. Why it is useful: It helps users keep track of changes made to their codebase and what needs to be committed.\n",
    "   iv. Where it might fit in a specific workflow: It is usually run before committing changes to ensure that only relevant changes are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Git diff**\n",
    "   i. What it does: Git diff shows differences between two states of a repository.\n",
    "   ii. How it works: The command compares two states of a repository (e.g., two commits or a commit and working directory) and shows what has changed between them. For example, to see the differences between two commits, you can use the following command: `git diff <commit1> <commit2>`.\n",
    "   iii. Why it is useful: It helps users understand what has changed between different versions of their codebase.\n",
    "   iv. Where it might fit in a specific workflow: It is usually run before committing changes to ensure that only relevant changes are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Git add**\n",
    "   i. What it does: Git add adds changes to the staging area.\n",
    "   ii. How it works: The command adds changes made to files in the working directory to the staging area so that they can be committed later using git commit. For example, to add all changes made to files in the current directory, you can use the following command: `git add .`.\n",
    "   iii. Why it is useful: It allows users to selectively choose which changes they want to include in their next commit.\n",
    "   iv. Where it might fit in a specific workflow: It is usually run after making changes to files but before committing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Git commit**\n",
    "   i. What it does: Git commit records changes made to files in the repository.\n",
    "   ii. How it works: The command creates a new commit that contains all changes made since the last commit along with a commit message describing those changes. For example, to create a new commit with message \"Add feature X\", you can use the following command: `git commit -m \"Add feature X\"`.\n",
    "   iii. Why it is useful: It allows users to keep track of changes made to their codebase over time and provides an audit trail for those changes.\n",
    "   iv. Where it might fit in a specific workflow: It is usually run after adding changes using git add and before pushing those changes to a remote repository.\n",

    "##### 13) what are the advantages of distriuted version control systems compared to centralised sysytems?\n",
    "\n",
    "Centralized version control systems (CVCS) and distributed version control systems (DVCS) are two types of version control systems used in software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a centralized version control system, the source code is stored in a central repository, and developers check out files from that repository to work on them. Changes are made locally and then committed back to the central repository. Examples of centralized version control systems include Subversion (SVN) and Perforce 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a distributed version control system allows developers to create local repositories on their machines, which can be used to track changes to the source code. Developers can then share changes with others by pushing their changes to a remote repository. Examples of distributed version control systems include Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed version control systems (DVCS) offer several advantages over centralized version control systems. Some of these advantages include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Offline work**: DVCS allows users to work productively when not connected to a network ¹.\n",
    "2. **Faster common operations**: Common operations such as commits, viewing history, and reverting changes are faster for DVCS because there is no need to communicate with a central server ¹.\n",
    "3. **Private work**: DVCS allows private work, so users can use their changes even for early drafts they do not want to publish ¹.\n",
    "4. **Faster actions**: Performing actions other than pushing and pulling changesets is extremely fast because the tool only needs to access the hard drive, not a remote server ¹.\n",
    "5. **Local committing**: Committing new changesets can be done locally without anyone else seeing them. Once you have a group of changesets ready, you can push all of them at once ¹.\n",
    "6. **Offline access**: Everything but pushing and pulling can be done without an internet connection ¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DVCS offers more flexibility and speed than centralized version control systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 14) How might a free and open-source software development team use version control sytems differently from closed-source software development teams?\n",
    "\n",
    "Free and open-source software development teams and closed-source software development teams use version control systems (VCS) differently. \n",
    "\n",
    "Free and open-source software development teams tend to use **distributed version control systems (DVCS)** more frequently than closed-source software development teams. DVCS allows developers to create local repositories on their machines, which can be used to track changes to the source code. Developers can then share changes with others by pushing their changes to a remote repository ¹. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, closed-source software development teams tend to use **centralized version control systems (CVCS)** more frequently than free and open-source software development teams. In a centralized version control system, the source code is stored in a central repository, and developers check out files from that repository to work on them. Changes are made locally and then committed back to the central repository ¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this difference is that free and open-source software development teams tend to be more distributed and collaborative than closed-source software development teams. DVCS allows developers to work independently on their own machines, which is ideal for distributed teams ¹. In contrast, CVCS is better suited for centralized teams where developers work in the same location or have access to a central server ¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, free and open-source software development teams tend to use DVCS more frequently than closed-source software development teams because it allows developers to work independently on their own machines, which is ideal for distributed teams.\n"
